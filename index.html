                    "Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in the wake of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched
                    commercial success—that there weren't a whole lot of artists who weren't trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula."
                </p>
